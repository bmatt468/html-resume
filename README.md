# My Resume
This repository contains my personal resume. I wanted to build my resume as a "webpage", so that editing it would be easy, and so I could build it using the tools that I use everyday.

The styling for the resume was built using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and the pdf was generated using the [html5-to-pdf package](https://github.com/peterdemartini/html5-to-pdf).

To view the HTML source for the resume, check the `src` folder, and if you would like the latest copy of the pdf, [click here](build/resume.pdf), or check the `build` folder.
